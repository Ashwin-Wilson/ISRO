                    <p>

                        The Aditya L1 mission is India's first dedicated mission to study the Sun. It was launched on
                        September 2, 2023, and is scheduled to reach its final orbit around the first Lagrangian point
                        (L1) of the Sun-Earth system in December 2023. <br>

                        Aditya L1 will be positioned at a distance of about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in a halo
                        orbit around L1. This location is ideal for studying the Sun because it is relatively free of
                        interference from Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. <br>

                        The spacecraft carries seven payloads that will study the Sun's atmosphere, corona, and solar
                        wind. <br>

                    <p>Chandrayaan-3 is a lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation
                        (ISRO). It is a follow-up mission to the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which launched in 2019 but
                        failed to land on the Moon. Chandrayaan-3 was launched on July 14, 2023, and is currently on its
                        way to the Moon.</p>
                    <p>The mission consists of a lander and a rover. The lander is designed to make a soft landing on
                        the lunar surface, and the rover will then explore the surrounding area. The rover is equipped
                        with a variety of scientific instruments to study the lunar soil, rocks, and atmosphere.</p>

                            the
                            one used on Chandrayaan-2.</li>

                            surface more safely.</li>

                        <li>>> The mission includes a new scientific payload called the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable
                            Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload. This payload will study the Earth's atmosphere from the lunar
                            orbit.</li>

                        The first Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) mission, SSLV-D1/EOS-02, was launched from the
                        Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, India on August 7, 2022. The objective of the mission
                        was to inject the EOS-02 and AzaadiSAT satellites into a circular orbit of 356.2 km with an
                        inclination of 37.21°.<br>

                        However, the mission failed to achieve its mission objectives. The rocket had a three stage
                        configuration with a fourth Velocity Trimming Module (VTM). In its D1 configuration, the rocket
                        was 34m tall with a diameter of 2m and a lift-off mass of 120t. <br>

                        Due to sensor failure coupled with shortcomings of onboard software, the stage as well as the
                        two satellite payloads were injected into an unstable transatmospheric Earth orbit measuring
                        356×76 km and subsequently destroyed upon reentry.

                    <p>The NVS-01 mission is a navigation satellite mission launched by the Indian Space Research
                        Organisation (ISRO) on May 29, 2023. The satellite was launched on the Geosynchronous Satellite
                        Launch Vehicle (GSLV) F12 rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India.</p>
                    <p>The NVS-01 satellite is the first of the second-generation satellites envisaged for the
                        Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services. The NavIC system is India's regional
                        navigation satellite system, similar to the US GPS system.</p>

                    <p>The NVS-01 satellite is equipped with a number of new features over the first-generation NavIC
                        satellites, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>>> A new L1 band signal, which will provide improved accuracy and coverage for NavIC users.
                        </li>
                        <li>>> An indigenous rubidium atomic clock, which will provide more precise timing for NavIC
                            signals.</li>

                        <li>>> A new ranging payload, which will enable precise orbit determination for the NavIC
                            system.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The NVS-01 satellite is expected to be in service for 12 years. It will provide navigation,
                        positioning, and timing services to users in India and the surrounding region.</p>
                    <p>The NVS-01 mission is a significant milestone for India's space program. It demonstrates India's
                        ability to design, develop, and launch advanced navigation satellites. The mission is also
                        expected to provide significant benefits to India's economy and society.</p>
