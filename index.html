It was founded in 1969 with the vision of harnessing space technology for national development. ISRO has achieved remarkable success in the field of space research and development, placing India among the leading spacefaring nations in the world.<br></p><h5 style="line-height:normal;font-family:Oswald,sans-serif" class="text-white">History of ISRO</h5><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p style="color:#fff">The history of ISRO can be traced back to 1962, when the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established. INCOSPAR was responsible for promoting and coordinating space research activities in India. In 1969, ISRO was formed to supersede INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology for national development.<br>ISRO's early years were focused on developing launch vehicles and satellites for communication and remote sensing applications. In 1975, ISRO launched its first satellite, Aryabhata, with the help of the Soviet Union. This was followed by the launch of a series of successful satellites, including Bhaskara-I (1979), Rohini-RS-1 (1980), and INSAT-1A (1983).<br>In the 1990s, ISRO began to develop more sophisticated launch vehicles and satellites. In 1992, ISRO launched its first indigenous launch vehicle, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The PSLV has since become ISRO's most successful launch vehicle, launching over 40 satellites into orbit.<br>In 2008, ISRO launched its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1. Chandrayaan-1 was a major success, mapping the lunar surface and detecting water ice on the moon. In 2013, ISRO launched its first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). MOM was a historic mission, as it made India the first Asian country to reach Mars orbit.<br></p></div><h5 style="line-height:normal;font-family:Oswald,sans-serif" class="text-white mt-3">Vikram Sarabhai</h5><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2 col-12 mt-2"><img style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:10px" src="assets/Vikram Sarabhai.webp" alt=""></div><div class="col-md-10 col-12"><p class="text-white mt-3">Vikram Sarabhai, often hailed as the father of the Indian space program, made groundbreaking contributions to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) that continue to shape India's space endeavors. His visionary leadership and scientific acumen laid the foundation for India's space exploration. Sarabhai recognized the potential of space technology for societal development, advocating its peaceful use. Under his guidance, ISRO launched its first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975, marking India's entry into the global space community. Sarabhai's emphasis on indigenous technology development led to the establishment of vital infrastructure like the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station and the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. His commitment to education and research also resulted in the creation of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), nurturing future generations of space scientists. Vikram Sarabhai's enduring legacy is evident in ISRO's continued achievements, making him a revered figure in India's space history.<br></p></div></div></div></div></section><section class="page-2"><div class="container d-flex align-items-center flex-column"><h4 style="line-height:normal;background-color:#111111c9;padding:.5rem;border-radius:20px" class="page-title text-white mt-5">KEY MILESTONES</h4><div class="row d-flex justify-content-around"><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 item saffron"><img style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:5px" src="assets/Milestones/Aditya L1-min.webp" alt=""><h5 style="line-height:normal" class="text-white">2023: India launches Aditya L1</h5><p class="text-white">2023: India launches Aditya L1.

Its headquarters are in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore). ISRO’s chief executive is a chairman, who is also chairman of the Indian government’s Space Commission and the secretary of the Department of Space. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) operates through a countrywide network of centres. Sensors and payloads are developed at the Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad. Satellites are designed, developed, assembled, and tested at the U R Rao Satellite Centre (formerly the ISRO Satellite Centre) in Bengaluru. Launch vehicles are developed at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram. Launches take place at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island, near Chennai. The Master Control Facilities for geostationary satellite station keeping are located at Hassan and Bhopal. Reception and processing facilities for remote-sensing data are at the National Remote Sensing Centre in Hyderabad. ISRO’s commercial arm is Antrix Corporation, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru. ISRO’s first satellite, Aryabhata, was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1975. Rohini, the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle (the Satellite Launch Vehicle 3), was launched on July 18, 1980. ISRO has launched several space systems, including the Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system for telecommunication, television broadcasting, meteorology, and disaster warning and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites for resource monitoring and management. The first INSAT was launched in 1988, and the program expanded to include geosynchronous satellites called GSAT. The first IRS satellite was also launched in 1988, and the program developed more-specialized satellites, including the Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1, launched in 2012) and the Satellite with Argos and Altika (SARAL, launched in 2013), a joint Indian-French mission that measures ocean wave heights. ISRO subsequently developed three other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for putting satellites into polar orbit, the Geostationary Space Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbit, and a heavy-lift version of the GSLV called the LVM3. Those rockets launched communications satellites and Earth-observation satellites as well as missions to the Moon (Chandrayaan-1, 2008; Chandrayaan-2, 2019) and Mars (Mars Orbiter Mission, 2013). ISRO plans to put astronauts into orbit with the Gaganyaan spacecraft in 2024.</p></div></section></body></html>
