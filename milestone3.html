It was named after Bhaskara-I, a renowned Indian mathematician from the 7th century. Bhaskara-I was launched on June 7, 1979, from the Volgograd Launch Station in Russia using a Soviet Intercosmos launch vehicle.</p><p>The primary mission of Bhaskara-I was to gather data for hydrology, oceanography, forestry, and telemetry. The satellite carried two television cameras operating in visible (600 nanometers) and near-infrared (800 nanometers) wavelengths, a satellite microwave radiometer (SAMIR) operating at 19 and 22 GHz frequencies, and an X-ray sky monitor operating in the 2-10 keV energy range.</p></div><div class="col-md-12"><p>Bhaskara-I was a successful mission, and it returned a wealth of data that was used for a variety of scientific studies. For example, the data from the television cameras was used to study snow cover, cloud cover, and vegetation cover. The data from SAMIR was used to study ocean surface temperature, sea ice cover, and atmospheric water vapor content. The data from the X-ray sky monitor was used to study transient X-ray sources and long-term spectral and intensity changes in X-ray sources.</p><p>Bhaskara-I re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on August 16, 1989. However, its legacy continues to live on. The data that it collected helped to lay the foundation for India's current remote sensing satellite program, which is one of the most advanced in the world.</p><p>The Bhaskara-I mission was a significant milestone for India's space program.
